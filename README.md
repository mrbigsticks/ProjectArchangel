# ProjectArchangel
Project Archangel is live-service SaaS that helps direct end-users to the appropriate softwares, and or websites they need access to with a single click of button. The SaaS is also expected to included a modern database that allows end-users to store, manage and manipulate data as they like from anywhere at anytime. The project is a WIP.
